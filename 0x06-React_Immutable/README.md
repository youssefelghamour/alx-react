# 0x06. React Immutable

## Overview

This project focuses on using Immutable.js to implement immutability in JavaScript and enhance React development. Tasks include converting objects to immutable Maps, accessing nested elements, creating immutable Lists, and performing merges and comparisons on Immutable Maps. The goal is to understand and apply immutability concepts effectively in front-end development.
